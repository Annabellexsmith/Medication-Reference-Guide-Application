## Challenges Encounted During Development:


## Next Steps:

&#9745; Be able to browse other userâ€™s medication libraries.

&#9744;  Adapt the app to be cell phone compatible.

&#9744;  Include a view page for resorces that would include URLs for MicroMedex, UpToDate, and other relivent websites for best practice.
