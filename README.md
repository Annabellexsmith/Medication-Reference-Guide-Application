# Medication-Reference-Guide-Application
Medication Reference Guide is a MEN Stacked CRUD application which I completed during my time in the Software Engineering Bootcamp at General Assembly. 
This project was inspired by my time working as an Oncology nurse. As a nurse, you administer a wide range of medications
and need to be able to give it safely. As such, there is a variety of ways nurses keep their notes on different medications. 
This project is combination of my passion for ensuring patients receive safe and effient care with my skills I'm learning at General 
Assembly.

## Next Steps:

&#9745; Be able to browse other nurses' medication libraries.

&#9744;  Adapt the app to be cell phone compatible.

&#9744;  Include a view page for resorces that would include URLs for MicroMedex, UpToDate, and other relevant websites for best practice.
